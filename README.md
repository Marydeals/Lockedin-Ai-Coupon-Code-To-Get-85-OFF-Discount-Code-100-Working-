## **What is LockedIn AI?**  

LockedIn AI refers to AI systems designed with **restricted access controls, heightened security protocols, and deep personalization** to ensure that interactions remain private, secure, and tailored to individual users. Unlike traditional AI models that operate in an open-ended manner, LockedIn AI operates within a "locked" environment where data access, model behavior, and outputs are tightly controlled.
